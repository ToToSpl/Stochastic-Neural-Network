# Stochastic-Neural-Network
Neural Network with stochastic activation function. It contains cpu implementation as well as gpu one.

## Used libraries

Stochastic neural network was written using NumPy and CuPy (for gpu). Other libraries like Keras are used for benchmarks.

## Credits

This work was written as a part of engineering thesis by Jacek Grzybowski.
